# Full Stack E-Commerce Platform
## Web Application Design - Team Project
### Team Members: Robert Negre & Cristina Pavel

Me and my colleague focused on developing a dynamic E-Commerce platform with
a versatile admin dashboard, utilizing Next.js 13 App Router, React, Tailwind, Prisma,
and MySQL. Key features include seamless management of multiple vendors and
stores, effortless creation, updating, and deletion of categories and products, robust
image management, and flexible filter creation.
The platform also offers many search capabilities, revenue insights, and seamless
integration with Clerk Authentication and Stripe. Powered by MySQL, Prisma, and
PlanetScale, the system ensures scalability and reliability for future growth.
